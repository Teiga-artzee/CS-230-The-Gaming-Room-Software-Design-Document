# CS-230-The-Gaming-Room-Software-Design-Document

Q1) Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirments. Who was the client, and what type of software did they want me to design?
=====================================================================================================================================================
A1) The Gaming Room was a fictional client for my Computer Science course CS 230. The client wanted to created a game named "Draw It or Lose It", an application that would draw a picture on screen. The players had 60 seconds to guess what the image was to score. Each player would be in teams. The application was designed in Eclipse using Java, but they wanted to make it so the application could be accessed online and allow for multiple players from different platforms to play together.

=====================================================================================================================================================
Q2) What did I do particulary well in developing this documentation?
=====================================================================================================================================================
A2) I was informative with the information I had gathered, and tried to remain unbiased with my findings as well as recommendations.

=====================================================================================================================================================
Q3) What about the process of working through a design documentation did I find helpful when developing the code?
=====================================================================================================================================================
A3) Understanding how to read the UML documentation and how each class and function worked together made it possible to develop the application properly. Developing and adding to the UML aided with the development as well.

=====================================================================================================================================================
Q4) If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, what would I pick and how would I improve it?
=====================================================================================================================================================
A4) I revised the recommendation portion of the document into bullet points. I did this to make the recommendations clear and easier to read.

=====================================================================================================================================================
Q5) How did I interpret the user's needs and implemement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing? 
=====================================================================================================================================================
A5) When considering the clients needs, delivering on what they ask for shows that you are capable of producing a product and will earn their business again in the future. When interpreting their needs, I developed pseudo code to help understand what it was they were asking for, as well as brainstorming different ways of implimentation or how others might approach it. It was necessary to look at examples when unsure about a specific request in order to deliver what they needed.

=====================================================================================================================================================
Q6) How did I approach designing the software? What techniques/strateiges would I use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
=====================================================================================================================================================
A6) I approached designing the software with the Object Orientated Principles to give the application portability, inheriting from classes, encapsulation, and polymorphism. I also incorporated the principles of design patterns, where I created concise objects, used encapsulation to protect those objects, and was purposeful with my inheritance. I created Psuedocode, followed by creating and completing an UML document to overview how each class, variable, and function behaved within the program. Taking these tools, I was able to effectively follow the blueprint I had developed alongside my guiding course documents and resources. Further strategies for the future include familiarizing myself with the delevopment of the client and server side code to gain a better understanding of how it can be used in future projects.
